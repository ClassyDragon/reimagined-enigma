## Current Progress:
1. Fluid horizontal *Tetramino* movement.
2. Piece generation algorithm
3. Piece rotation!

## TO-DO:
1. Implement horizontal movement and dropping
2. Implement Line-clearing
3. Score-keeping, speed changes, lose condition, etc.
4. Bounds checking when rotating piece (rotating through walls, pieces, etc.)

**This project is very incomplete. There are a lot of things I plan to change to make reading and modifying the code easier.
Updates will be infrequent for this project.**
