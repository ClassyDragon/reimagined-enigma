# reimagined-enigma
Simple open-source Tetris Game made using C++ and the SFML Library.

Current Progress:
1. Fluid horizontal Tetramino movement.
2. Piece generation algorithm

TO-DO:
1. Implement Piece rotation
2. Implement horizontal movement and dropping
3. Implement Line-clearing
4. Score-keeping, speed changes, lose condition, etc.

This project is very incomplete. There are a lot of things I plan to change to make reading and modifying the code easier.
Updates will be infrequent for this project.
