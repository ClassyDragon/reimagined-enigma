# reimagined-enigma
Simple open-source Tetris Game made using C++ and the SFML Library.

## Current Progress:
1. Fluid horizontal *Tetramino* movement.
2. Piece generation algorithm
3. Piece rotation!
4. Vertical movement
5. Bounds checking when rotating piece against blocks in field
6. Line-clearing
7. Hard Drop
8. Super Rotation System (SRS)
9. Ghost Piece
10. Soft Drop

## TO-DO:
1. Score-keeping, speed changes, lose condition, etc.
2. Hold Piece

## BUGS:
1. In some situations, rotating while moving can cause blocks to rotate where they should be able to.

## Needs Improved:
1. Representation of solid tiles in field.
2. Moving blocks down when a line is cleared

**This project is very incomplete. There are a lot of things I plan to change to make reading and modifying the code easier.
Updates will be infrequent for this project.**
