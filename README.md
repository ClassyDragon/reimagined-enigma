# reimagined-enigma
Simple open-source Tetris Game made using C++ and the SFML Library.

## Current Progress:
1. Fluid horizontal *Tetramino* movement.
2. Piece generation algorithm
3. Piece rotation!
4. Vertical movement

## TO-DO:
1. Implement Line-clearing
2. Score-keeping, speed changes, lose condition, etc.
3. Bounds checking when rotating piece against blocks in field (rotating through walls already prevented)
4. Soft and Hard Dropping.

**This project is very incomplete. There are a lot of things I plan to change to make reading and modifying the code easier.
Updates will be infrequent for this project.**
